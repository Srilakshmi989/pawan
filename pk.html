            Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.[66] He wrote a book titled Ism
            which is
            also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.[67] He met with then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime
            ministerial
            candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his
            support.[68] He
            campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He
            opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the
            Country' in Hindi).[69] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and
            Telangana.[70] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October
            2017
            once he completes his film commitments.[71]

            Kalyan brought the Uddanam kidney disease crisis to the attention of media and politicians through protests
            and
            a hunger strike. Government of Andhra Pradesh responded by constructing dialysis centers and implementing
            various schemes for the village.[72][73] In November 2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will contest in
            the
            2019 general elections in Andhra Pradesh.[74] He stated that he was planning to contest from all 175
            legislatures of Andhra Pradesh without any alliance.[75] He opposed central government's move to privatise
            Dredging Corporation of India (DCI)[76] on a golden platter.[77] Kalyan led a protest march to condolence
            farmers who committed suicides or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema.[78] He opposed the
            TDP
            Government's decision on land pooling.[79] Kalyan conducted a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage in
            Rajahmundry demanding political accountability.[80] He exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserve
            forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu in East Godavari district.[81]

            Kalyan has announced the Jana Sena party's 2019 election manifesto at Rajahmundry[82] public meeting with
            many
            measures to improve the lives of farmers,[83] farm labourers, women, youth, and students. His party would
            contest together with left parties[84] Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and
            Bahujan
            Samaj Party[85] for the upcoming 2019 elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. At
            the
            same time, when he was actively campaigning for the elections all around Andhra Pradesh, he fell sick and
            shared
            a few health problems. As he was getting ready for his next round of campaign at Sattenapalle, he felt dizzy
            and
            nauseated. When the chopper was down for refilling at Gannavaram airport, he was down with vomiting,
            dehydration, and drowsiness. Immediately then, he was hospitalized and treated in Vijayawada. Again the
            campaign
            resumed after he got well.[86][87]

            The Jana Sena Party has contested 140 constituencies in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly
            elections.
            Kalyan has contested two constituencies – Gajuwaka[88] and Bhimavaram.[89] He has lost in both to candidates
            from YSR Congress Party.[90] His party was able to win from Razole, making it the only seat it has won in
            the
            election.[91]

            Later the same year, on 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction
            workers against YSR Congress Party governance who have been facing unemployment due to shortage of supply of
            sand in Andhra Pradesh.[92]

            On 16 January 2020, Kalyan has announced his party's alliance with BJP, after three years of distancing from
            it.
            Both the parties fought together in elections of 2024.[93] On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice
            to
            Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool.[94] He demanded an inquiry by
            Central
            Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident.[95]

            The Jana Sena Party contested 21 constituencies in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election,
            with
            Kalyan contesting in Pithapuram constituency. He won by a margin of more than 70,000 votes; Jana Sena Party
            won
            in all the contested twenty-one assembly constituencies and two Lok Sabha seats.[96]

            On 12 June 2024 Kalyan was sworn in as a cabinet minister of Andhra Pradesh, whereas on 16 June 2024, he was
            announced as the deputy chief minister.
